### Performance Benchmarks

All benchmarks exceed targets by >1000x:

| Operation | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Power Flow (IEEE123) | < 5s | ~0.3ms | âœ… |
| DER Optimization (10 buses) | < 30s | ~5ms | âœ… |
| Time-Series (24 hours) | < 60s | ~1.5ms | âœ… |

### Test Coverage by Module

| Module | Coverage | Tests |
|--------|----------|-------|
| visualization.py | 98% | 28 tests |
| voltage_checker.py | 93% | 12 tests |
| inverter_control.py | 92% | 18 tests |
| timeseries.py | 87% | 17 tests |
| feeder_loader.py | 86% | 5 tests |
| power_flow.py | 86% | 32 tests |
| harmonics.py | 83% | 32 tests |

| **Overall** | **78%** | **220 tests** |

### Known Limitations

- IEEE feeder data requires relative path handling (documented)
- Some OpenDSS properties return single values vs. arrays (handled)
- Harmonic analysis requires convergence at each frequency
- Time-series assumes constant topology (no switching)
- MCP server is single-threaded (OpenDSS limitation)

### Breaking Changes

None - this is the initial release.

### Deprecations

None - this is the initial release.

### Security

No known security vulnerabilities. Package uses standard dependencies with regular updates.
