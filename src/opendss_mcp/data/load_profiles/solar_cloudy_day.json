    "24 hourly values starting at midnight (hour 0)",
    "Reduced peak generation (70% of clear day) due to cloud cover",
    "Irregular profile with variability representing cloud movement",
    "Overall generation reduced by approximately 30-40% vs clear day",
    "Peak around solar noon (hour 11) but lower and less consistent",
    "Some afternoon dips representing thicker cloud coverage",
    "Zero generation during nighttime hours",
    "Normalized to cloudy day peak of 0.7 (70% of clear day irradiance)",
    "Represents typical partly cloudy conditions",
    "Actual generation highly variable depending on cloud density and movement"
