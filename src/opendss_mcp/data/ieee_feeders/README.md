# IEEE Test Feeders

This directory contains IEEE test feeder models in OpenDSS format.

## Sources

- **IEEE 13 Node Test Feeder**: Simplified model based on the IEEE 13 Node Test Feeder
- **IEEE 34 Node Test Feeder**: Simplified model based on the IEEE 34 Node Test Feeder
- **IEEE 123 Node Test Feeder**: Simplified model based on the IEEE 123 Node Test Feeder

## Notes

- These are minimal working examples for testing purposes.
- For more detailed models, refer to the original IEEE test feeder specifications.
- The models include basic components like buses, lines, loads, transformers, and voltage sources.
- All models are configured for power flow analysis in OpenDSS.
