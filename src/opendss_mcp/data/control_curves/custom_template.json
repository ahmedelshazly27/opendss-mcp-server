    "REQUIRED FIELDS:",
    "- name: Unique identifier for the curve (uppercase, no spaces)",
    "- description: Human-readable description",
    "- type: Currently only 'volt-var' is supported",
    "- points: Array of [voltage, var] coordinate pairs",
    "",
    "POINTS FORMAT:",
    "- Each point is [voltage_pu, var_pu]",
    "- voltage_pu: Voltage in per-unit (typically 0.90 - 1.10)",
    "- var_pu: Reactive power in per-unit of rated inverter kVA",
    "- Positive vars = absorb (inductive, lagging)",
    "- Negative vars = inject (capacitive, leading)",
    "",
    "GUIDELINES:",
    "- Points must be sorted by voltage (ascending)",
    "- Minimum 2 points required, 10 points maximum recommended",
    "- Typical var range: -0.44 to +0.44 (per IEEE 1547)",
    "- Include a deadband (zero var region) around 1.0 pu for stability",
    "",
    "EXAMPLE USE CASES:",
    "- Voltage support: Inject vars at low voltage, absorb at high voltage",
    "- Utility-specific curves: Match local interconnection requirements",
    "- Research: Test custom control strategies"
