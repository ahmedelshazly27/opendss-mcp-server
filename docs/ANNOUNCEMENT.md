🚀 **Introducing OpenDSS MCP Server v1.0.0 - Transforming Power System Analysis with AI**

After months of development, I'm excited to announce the release of OpenDSS MCP Server - an open-source project that brings conversational AI to power system analysis.

**The Problem:**
Traditional distribution planning studies take 2-3 weeks of manual work. Engineers spend countless hours running simulations, analyzing results, and optimizing DER placement. The learning curve for OpenDSS is steep, and complex analyses require deep expertise.

**The Solution:**
OpenDSS MCP Server enables natural language interaction with EPRI's OpenDSS through Claude and other AI assistants. Ask questions in plain English, get instant results, and iterate rapidly.

**What You Can Do:**
✅ Load IEEE test feeders (13, 34, 123 bus) instantly
✅ Run power flow analysis with harmonics in seconds
✅ Optimize DER placement across multiple scenarios
✅ Check voltage violations with customizable limits
✅ Analyze hosting capacity with confidence
✅ Simulate 24-hour time-series operations
✅ Generate network diagrams and visualizations
✅ Apply smart inverter controls (IEEE 1547, Rule 21)
✅ Perform harmonic analysis (THD calculations)

**Performance:**
- Power flow on IEEE123: <1ms (target: 5s)
- DER optimization (10 candidates): ~5ms (target: 30s)
- 24-hour simulation: ~1.5ms (target: 60s)

**Built For:**
- Distribution planning engineers
- DER integration specialists
- Utility planning departments
- Power systems researchers
- Energy consultants

**Tech Stack:**
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic
- OpenDSS via opendssdirect.py
- 220 passing tests, 78% coverage
- Python 3.10+ with comprehensive type hints

**Impact:**
Reduce planning studies from weeks to minutes. Democratize power systems analysis. Enable faster innovation in grid modernization.

**Title:** [Project Launch] OpenDSS MCP Server v1.0.0 - Conversational AI for Power System Analysis

**Body:**

Hi everyone! I'm excited to share a project I've been working on that brings AI-powered natural language interaction to power system analysis.

## What is it?

OpenDSS MCP Server is an open-source tool that lets you interact with EPRI's OpenDSS power system simulator using natural language through Claude or other AI assistants. Instead of writing scripts, you can ask questions and get results conversationally.

## The Problem

As someone who's worked in distribution planning, I've experienced the pain points:
- Traditional studies take 2-3 weeks of manual work
- OpenDSS has a steep learning curve
- Iteration cycles are slow and tedious
- Complex analyses require deep expertise

## The Solution

Natural language interface to OpenDSS through the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

```
You: "Load the IEEE 123 bus test feeder and run a power flow analysis"
AI: *Loads feeder, runs analysis, returns voltage profiles and losses*

You: "Find the optimal location for a 500kW solar installation to minimize losses"
AI: *Evaluates candidates, runs optimization, recommends best location*

You: "Show me a network diagram with voltage violations highlighted"
AI: *Generates visualization with color-coded buses*
```

## Key Capabilities

**9 Core Tools Implemented:**
1. ✅ Load IEEE test feeders (13/34/123 bus)
2. ✅ Power flow analysis with optional harmonics
3. ✅ DER placement optimization with volt-var control
4. ✅ Voltage violation detection
5. ✅ Hosting capacity analysis
6. ✅ Time-series simulation
7. ✅ Network visualization
8. ✅ Smart inverter control (IEEE 1547, Rule 21)
9. ✅ Harmonic analysis (THD)

## Performance

Benchmarks exceed targets by >1000x:
- Power flow on IEEE123: ~0.3ms (target: <5s)
- DER optimization (10 candidates): ~5ms (target: <30s)
- 24-hour simulation: ~1.5ms (target: <60s)

## Tech Details

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Protocol:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic
- **OpenDSS Interface:** opendssdirect.py
- **Testing:** 220 tests, 78% coverage
- **Code Quality:** Black formatted, 8.38/10 pylint score

**Example workflow:**
- "Load IEEE 123 bus feeder and run power flow" → Done in <1ms
- "Find optimal location for 500kW solar" → Analyzes 10 locations in ~5ms
- "Show voltage violations" → Network diagram with color-coded issues

**Technical highlights:**
- 9 MCP tools for complete power system analysis
- 220 tests, 78% coverage
- Performance >1000x faster than targets
- Python 3.10+ with full type hints
- MIT licensed

Built this because I wanted to democratize power systems analysis. Grid modernization needs better tools.
