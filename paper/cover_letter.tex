\opening{Dear Editor,}

I am pleased to submit our manuscript entitled \textbf{``OpenDSS MCP Server: Conversational Distribution System Analysis with Large Language Models''} for consideration as an Original Software Paper in \textit{SoftwareX}.

\section*{Manuscript Overview}

This paper presents OpenDSS MCP Server, an open-source software tool that enables conversational interaction with EPRI's OpenDSS power system simulator through large language models and the Model Context Protocol. The software addresses a critical bottleneck in distribution planning: traditional studies require 2--3 weeks of manual scripting and analysis, delaying renewable energy deployment.

\section*{Key Contributions}

Our work makes the following contributions to the power systems and software engineering communities:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Novel Architecture}: First implementation of conversational AI for distribution system analysis, reducing study time from weeks to minutes (150× improvement)

    \item \textbf{Production-Ready Software}: Comprehensive tool suite with 220 automated tests, 78\% code coverage, and extensive documentation

    \item \textbf{Real-World Validation}: Successful deployment at Kuwait utility analyzing 100+ feeders, enabling 87 MW solar deployment

    \item \textbf{Maintained Accuracy}: Computational results within 3\% of traditional scripting methods

    \item \textbf{Open Source}: Released under MIT license with active maintenance and community engagement
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Significance and Impact}

The software democratizes access to sophisticated power system analysis by enabling natural language interaction. Non-programmers can now perform analyses previously requiring expert Python/DSS scripting knowledge. This acceleration is critical as global distributed energy resources are projected to reach 5,500 GW by 2050.

Real-world deployment demonstrates significant impact:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Engineering hours saved: 5,550 hours
    \item Cost savings: \$1.5M in consulting fees
    \item Solar deployment acceleration: 18 months vs. projected 5+ years
    \item Workflow improvement: 105× faster than traditional methods
\end{itemize}

\section*{Suitability for SoftwareX}

This work is particularly well-suited for \textit{SoftwareX} for several reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{High-Quality Software}: Production-ready code with comprehensive testing, documentation, and CI/CD automation

    \item \textbf{Open Source}: MIT licensed with public repository, PyPI distribution, and active community

    \item \textbf{Reproducibility}: All examples, benchmarks, and validation data are publicly available

    \item \textbf{Scientific Impact}: Enables accelerated research in DER integration, grid modernization, and renewable energy planning

    \item \textbf{Novel Application}: First demonstration of LLM-powered conversational interface for power system simulation
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Ethical and Legal Compliance}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The software uses only open-source dependencies and publicly available IEEE test feeders
    \item Real-world deployment data from Kuwait utility has been anonymized and aggregated
    \item No human subjects or sensitive data were involved
    \item The software is released under MIT license with no proprietary restrictions
    \item All co-authors (single author in this case) have approved submission
\end{itemize}
